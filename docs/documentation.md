# AI Job Market Intelligence Dashboard
**Data Science Project Documentation**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world job postings to identify in-demand skills across data-related roles.
It also provides personalized learning recommendations by comparing candidate skills with market requirements.

The goal is to help students and professionals understand current job market trends and identify skill gaps
in a clear and interactive way.

---

## 2. Data Sources

The project uses two primary datasets:

- **Jobs dataset**: Contains job titles, companies, locations, levels, and job types.
- **Skills dataset**: Maps job postings to associated technical and analytical skills.

Both datasets are linked using a common job identifier.

---

## 3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before analysis, the datasets were cleaned to ensure data quality and consistency.

### Jobs Data
- No duplicate job records were found.
- One missing value was identified in the job location column.
- Relevant columns were retained for analysis, including job title, company, and cleaned job role.

### Skills Data
- No missing values were present.
- Duplicate skill entries were identified and handled during aggregation.

This ensured reliable skill frequency calculations.

---

## 4. Skill Normalization

To ensure consistency across skill names:

- Skill text was converted to lowercase
- Variations and formatting inconsistencies were removed
- Skills were standardized before aggregation

This helped avoid treating the same skill as multiple different entries.

---

## 5. Skill Demand Analysis

The cleaned and normalized data was used to:

- Identify top skills required for each job role
- Calculate overall skill demand across all roles
- Rank skills based on job posting frequency

This analysis highlights the most valuable skills in the current job market.

---

## 6. Skill Gap & Learning Recommendations

Candidate-provided skills are compared against the top skills required for a selected role.

The system identifies:
- Skills already possessed by the candidate
- Missing skills based on market demand
- Learning priorities classified as High, Medium, or Low

This allows users to focus on the most impactful skills first.
